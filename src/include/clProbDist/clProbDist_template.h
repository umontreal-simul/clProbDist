/*! @file clProbDist_template.h
 *  @brief Template of the API for specific probability distributions (not to be included as is!)
 *
 *  The function and type names in this API all start with \c clprobdist.
 *  In each specific implementation, prefixes to function names are expanded to
 *  a specific prefix and the generic distribution object type \c
 *  clprobdistObject is replaced with a specific distribution object type.
 *  Also, \ref vartype is replaced with `cl_double` for continuous
 *  distributions or with `cl_int` for discrete distributions.
 *  For example, the generic declaration
 *  \code
 *  vartype clprobdistInverseCDFWithObject(const clprobdistObject* dist, cl_double u, clprobdistStatus* err);
 *  \endcode
 *  expands to
 *  \code
 *  cl_int clprobdistPoissonInverseCDFWithObject(const clprobdistPoisson* dist, cl_double u, clprobdistStatus* err);
 *  \endcode
 *  for the Poisson distribution, and to
 *  \code
 *  cl_double clprobdistExponentialInverseCDFWithObject(const clprobdistExponential* dist, cl_double u, clprobdistStatus* err);
 *  \endcode
 *  for the normal distribution.
 *
 *  The API of each distribution, except for the standard normal that has no
 *  parameter, comes in two flavors: using a distribution object or using
 *  explicit distribution parameters.
 *  Since the number of parameters and their names vary across distributions,
 *  in the generic description of the API below, the list of distribution
 *  parameters is abbreviated by `DIST_PARAMS` in the function signatures, and
 *  should be replaced by the appropriate list of parameters, given in \ref
 *  distributions for each distribution.
 *
 *
 *  ### Host and Device APIs
 *
 *  The functions described here are all available on the host, in all implementations,
 *  unless specified otherwise.  Only some of the functions and types are also
 *  available on the device in addition to the host;  they are tagged with
 *  [**device**].
 *  Other functions are only available on the device; they are tagged with
 *  [**device-only**].
 *  Some functions return an error code in \c err.
 *
 *  \todo Explain that on the device, the distribution object needs to be
 *  copied to local memory.  (Is this actually faster than the cache for global
 *  read-only memory?)
